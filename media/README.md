# Uno.Effects media

Captured from `mtmattei/uno.particles` @ `681211d`, gallery Release build, Skia Desktop on Linux (Xvfb).

| Folder | What |
|---|---|
| `art/` | 16 finished art pieces + `00-library-poster.jpg`. Captioned with the catalog number and description. |
| `art/clean/` | Same 16 pieces without captions, for backgrounds and crops. |
| `screenshots/` | Real gallery UI at 1600×1000: board, filtered board, detail pages, light surface, SKSL tab, diagnostics. |
| `recording/` | `gallery-walkthrough.mp4` — 45 s, 1600×1000, 30 fps, real time. |
| `tweet.md` | Launch tweet drafts and which images to attach. |
| `_source/` | Shot lists and scripts to regenerate the art, poster and recording. |

## How the art was made

The effects were driven by their own `ParticleEffect.Render` at a fixed 1/60 s timestep,
the same loop the render tests use, but at 1280–2560 px instead of 256. Files named
`*-longexp` lighten-blend the last N frames into one image (a long exposure); `*-paper`
uses a light surface with dark ink and darken-blends. No pixels are painted by hand.

Palettes are built around the gallery's amber accent (`#D6A068`) and warm neutrals close to
its surfaces. The only knobs moved off their defaults are Plasma (`Cells` 96) and Phyllotaxis
(`Count` 400, `Size` 1.6), as listed in `shots.json`. The finishing pass (`finish.py`) adds
bloom on bright pixels only, a vignette, film grain and the caption.

## Regenerate

Needs a checkout of `mtmattei/uno.particles` at `681211d` (private for now), the .NET 10 SDK,
and Python 3 with Pillow and NumPy. Fonts: Inter and DejaVu Sans Mono. If they are not in a
standard font folder, set `UNO_FX_FONTS` to the folder that has them.

From the library root, with `SRC` set to this repo's `media/_source` folder:

```
git apply $SRC/App.xaml.cs.capture.patch
cp $SRC/ArtRenderer.cs samples/Gallery/Uno.Effects.Gallery/
dotnet build samples/Gallery/Uno.Effects.Gallery -f net10.0-desktop -c Release
```

The patch adds `--art <spec.json> <outDir>` and `--window WxH` to the gallery. It is for capture
only and is not meant for the library.

Then, with `G` set to `samples/Gallery/Uno.Effects.Gallery/bin/Release/net10.0-desktop/Uno.Effects.Gallery`
(`.exe` on Windows, called as `& $G` in PowerShell; prefix `xvfb-run -a` on a Linux box with no display):

```
$G --art $SRC/shots.json raw/
python $SRC/finish.py raw/ out/
python $SRC/poster.py out/clean out/00-library-poster.jpg
```

`out/` then mirrors `art/`. The full-size renders take a few minutes; for a quick check, set
`"scale": 1` on every shot.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `shots.json` | The 16 published shots and their final parameters. |
| `candidates.json` | Two shots that were rendered and not kept (bokeh over nebula, sphere). Kept so they can be revisited. |
| `ArtRenderer.cs` | Capture-only renderer: fixed timestep, any size, optional long exposure. |
| `finish.py` | Bloom, vignette, grain, scrim and caption. Captions are the catalog's own number, name and description. |
| `poster.py` | The 4×4 library poster from `art/clean`. |
| `drive.py` | Scripted pointer for the recording. |

### Recording

Linux only (`xdotool`). Run the gallery with `--window 1600x1000` with its client area at the
top-left of the display, then:

```
ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size 1600x1000 -framerate 30 -i $DISPLAY -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -crf 18 gallery-walkthrough.mp4 &
python drive.py
```

`drive.py` uses fixed screen coordinates for that window size. The ffmpeg line reproduces the
published file's format (H.264, 1600×1000, 30 fps); the exact flags of the original capture
were not recorded.

## Caveat on numbers

The Metaballs detail screenshot's footer shows ~280 ms per frame. That is SKSL on the CPU
raster backend in a 4-core cloud VM, not a representative figure. The Constellation
diagnostics shot (57 fps, 3.6 ms) is typical for the particle effects.
