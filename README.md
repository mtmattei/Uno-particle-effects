# Uno.Effects

Particle and shader effects for Uno Platform, drawn with SkiaSharp through a
single `ParticleView` control, plus the gallery app that shows them off, lets
you tune them, hands you the code, and tests them.

This is **Phase 1** of the recommendation in
[`Uno Effects Recommendation.dc.html`](https://claude.ai/design/p/7b2677f1-35c8-4329-ac51-392436f2222a?file=Uno+Effects+Recommendation.dc.html)
carried through to the full set: `ParticleView` plus all **64** studies from the
sheet, the board and the detail view, Desktop and WebAssembly heads, and
deterministic render tests over every effect.

## Using an effect

```xml
xmlns:fx="using:Uno.Effects.Particles"

<fx:ParticleView Interactive="True">
    <fx:Snow Count="120" Speed="0.8" />
</fx:ParticleView>
```

`ParticleView` is the only control. Effects are its content, so a view is one
element with its layers as children. Effects are `DependencyObject`s, so every
knob is bindable, animatable from a Storyboard or VisualState, and visible to a
designer property panel.

All 64 studies from the sheet are ported, in its own order, so the number under
each tile matches the original board. They are grouped by family, one file each:

| Family        | Count | Effects |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| `Atmosphere`  | 11    | Dust, Snow, Rain, Smoke, Fog, Confetti, Bubbles, Pollen, Ash, Sandstorm, Leaves |
| `Light`       | 15    | Fireflies, Sparks, Twinkle, Orbs, Embers, Lightning, Bokeh, Fireworks, Fountain, Burst, Sparkle, Nebula, Meteors, Sparkler, Arcs |
| `Paths`       | 15    | Starfield, Trail, Loop, SinePath, Constellation, Orbits, Wave, Lissajous, Galaxy, Helix, Cascade, Breath, Phyllotaxis, Cube, Sphere |
| `Fields`      | 10    | FlowField, CurlNoise, Flock, Gravity, Ripples, Dipole, Attractor, Vortex, Tornado, Ink |
| `Interactive` | 4     | Follow, Repel, Lattice, Filings |
| `Procedural`  | 9     | Plasma, Metaballs, Grain, Halftone, Aurora, Shimmer, Static, PulseGrid, Blob |

Plasma and Metaballs are SKSL runtime shaders; everything else draws with
`SKCanvas`. Effects that add their own knob say so on their detail page —
`Snow.Sway`, `Fireflies.BlinkRate`, `Follow.Attraction`, `Repel.Reach`,
`Metaballs.Threshold`, `Plasma.Cells`.

Every effect also carries the common knobs it honours — `Count`, `Speed`,
`Size`, `Opacity`, `Seed`, and where they mean something, `Direction` and
`Gravity`. `Count` and `Size` treat 0 as "the value this effect was designed
around", so the defaults are the tuned ones and a written-out value is always a
deliberate one.

`Palette` is a list of brushes rather than colours, so an effect can be handed
theme resources and will follow a light/dark switch without any code. Index 0 is
the primary ink, index 1 the accent.

## The gallery

```
dotnet run --project samples/Gallery/Uno.Effects.Gallery -f net10.0-desktop
```

- **Board** — every catalog effect drawn by the real `ParticleView`. Idle tiles
  hold a settled frame and cost nothing; hovering starts the clock. Chips filter
  by category, by shader-based, and by measured cost.
- **Detail** — full-size preview, a property panel built from each effect's
  declared ranges, a light/dark surface toggle that flips the palette, the
  diagnostics overlay, and the generated XAML, C# and SKSL.
- **Copy** — the generated markup writes only the knobs that differ from the
  effect's own defaults, so it stays as short as the snippet above however long
  the panel gets.

Two switches, both used by the tests and the docs embed:

```
--effect <id>                  open straight on that effect's detail page
--render-tests [--output DIR]  run the deterministic render tests and exit
```

## Testing

`--render-tests` drives every effect at a fixed 1/60 s timestep onto a 256x256
surface and hashes frames 0, 60 and 300, twice, comparing the runs. It also
reports steady-state allocation per frame and median frame time, and writes the
frames as PNGs.

The harness lives in the app rather than beside it. That is deliberate: effects
are `DependencyObject`s, so they need a running Uno app, and running the tests
*inside* the gallery means one harness covers every head instead of a second,
headless implementation of the same thing. Comparing the printed hashes between
heads is the render-consistency test.

Measured on Skia Desktop (Windows, CPU raster), 256x256, all 64 effects:

| | median frame time | allocation per frame |
|---|---|---|
| 62 particle and CPU effects | 0.03 – 1.3 ms | 16 – 295 B |
| Plasma (SKSL) | ~3 – 5 ms | ~10 KB |
| Metaballs (SKSL) | ~5 – 18 ms | ~10 KB |

The particle effects hold the recommendation's budget with room to spare and
allocate essentially nothing per frame — the emitters keep fixed-capacity pools
and swap dead particles out rather than using a growable list, which is what
keeps that number flat.

**The shader effects do not**, and the reason is worth knowing before the CI
budgets in Phase 2 are written: on the CPU raster backend every SKSL
instruction is interpreted per pixel, and each frame allocates one `SKShader`.
Metaballs in particular sits at or above the recommendation's 8 ms desktop
budget at 256x256. Adding a `break` once the active blob count is passed cut it
roughly threefold; the rest is the backend. A GPU-backed surface, or evaluating
the field at a coarser resolution, is the Phase 2 fix. Until then Metaballs is
honestly labelled heavy.

## Performance

The per-effect numbers above are one half of the picture; the other half is what
a board of 64 live views costs, which is where the real problems were.

**Settling is time-boxed.** A newly emitted pool is settled over 90 frames so an
idle tile shows a real frame rather than a first tick. Doing all 90 in one go
made the worst tile (Metaballs) hold the UI thread for **226 ms**, and the board
as a whole did **2.5 seconds** of settling — twice, because layout runs at two
different tile widths before it comes to rest. `ParticleView` now spends at most
4 ms a frame settling and continues on the next frame. Measured on the same
board: **one** frame over 8 ms, worst **9.7 ms**. The rendered frames are
byte-identical before and after, which the render-test hashes confirm.

**Native objects are released deterministically.** `ParticleEffect` is
`IDisposable` and disposes its `SKPaint`; `ShaderEffect` also disposes its
compiled effect and builder; `ParticleView` disposes its surface, blit paint and
diagnostics objects when it unloads. Filtering the board discards 64 views at a
time, so waiting for finalization here is the difference between a steady
process and one that holds far more native memory than it is using.

**The surface colour is resolved on change, not per frame.** It is read twice a
frame by every view on the board; a dependency-property lookup and a brush cast
at that rate is not free.

Still open, and deliberately so: the board realizes all 64 tiles rather than
virtualizing them, so every tile owns a surface whether or not it is scrolled
into view. At ~450 KB a tile that is around 28 MB, and the viewport check
already stops the clock for tiles that are off screen. An `ItemsRepeater` would
fix the memory too, and is the obvious next step if the catalog grows well past
64.

## Decisions and deviations from the recommendation

- **Catalog.json lists effects; attributes describe them.** The recommendation
  puts name, category, tags, cost and knobs in the catalog file. Those all live
  on the effect type instead, in `[Effect]` and `[EffectProperty]`, because the
  designer toolbox has to read the same metadata and two copies would drift.
  Catalog.json keeps what it alone knows: which effects the gallery shows and in
  what order. Adding effect 65 is still one C# class plus one catalog entry.
- **`ParticleView.Surface`, not `Background`.** `FrameworkElement.Background`
  already exists in Uno, and shadowing a base dependency property is a good way
  to get a binding that silently targets the wrong one.
- **Composition knobs.** `Blur`, `BlendMode` and `Paused` are implemented.
  `Mask` is not; it needs a brush-to-shader conversion that earns its place
  later rather than in Phase 1.
- **Windows head.** Not enabled. `SKCanvasElement` needs the Skia renderer, so
  the WinAppSDK head is exactly the open question the recommendation raises, and
  Phase 1 does not need to answer it.
- **Hot Design metadata** (the `.Design` assembly) is Phase 3. The attributes it
  would read are already in place.
- **One file per family, not per effect.** The recommendation says adding an
  effect is one C# class plus one catalog entry, and that still holds; sixty-four
  single-class files simply made the folder harder to read than six that group
  by category.
- **Square-tile assumptions.** Several studies sized their circles off the width
  alone, because the sheet was drawn on square tiles. Here they use the shorter
  side, and the grid effects derive their row count from the cell size. Both are
  identical on a square tile and stay inside the frame on a wide one.
